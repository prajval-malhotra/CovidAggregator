# CovidAggregator

* An app that connects those who need emergency resources with those who have them. 
* Developed at the time when Covid was at it's peak in India, with a severe lack of Oxygen Cylinders and 
  other medical equipment, to help make a centralized go to stop for obtaining life saving resources.
* Used React Native to create the fronend.
* Created REST API with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB for the database.
